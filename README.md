# <u><font size=20>SPEED TEST GAME</font></u> <br>

<font size=4>This is a small game that enables a user to test his typing speed in real time.<br>
This project was built on top of the pygame libary. I took advantage of the pygame libary and <br>
created the whole project relaying on python OOP technique.<br>
<p> ## Note ## that the text to type are not much.<br>
 Feel free to fork this project and just re-modify it and add enough text to it.<br>
